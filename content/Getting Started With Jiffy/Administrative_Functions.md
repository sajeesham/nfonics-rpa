Jiffy Admin is responsible for managing the key administrative functions in Jiffy. All admin functionalities are available under *Settings* in the Main Menu. Admin functionalities include: 

 1. Manage Users 
 + Define Roles 
 + Assign Roles to Users
 + Manage Functions 
 
**Manage Users :**
 
 To create new users, Activate/de-activate a user, View the list of users, View the details of individual users.

**Define Roles & Assign Roles to Users:** 
 
 In Jiffy, the user accesses are controlled through the roles assigned against each user. Roles works as given below,

 * For each user action, there will be a pre defined permission in Jiffy. For example, Add a Task, Update a task, Approve repository update, Add XML data to repository etc. These permissions are categorized under three Entity Types – Function, Process and Repository. For example, all permissions related to Repository actions are defined under Entity Type Repository.	
 + Admin users can create different Roles (*Settings -> Roles -> Add Role*) by choosing required permissions to it. Roles also will be defined at Entity Level, i.e under one Role, permissions related to only one entity type can be added. But multiple Roles can be created for each Entity type by choosing relevant permissions defined under that entity type. 
 + Assign the Roles to users created, so that the user gets access as per the permissions added to the Role.
