{{< toggle title="Data Sources" type="separator">}}
These are the data nodes which can be used to provide input data for the tasks

<br/>
<br/>
<b>CSV Data</b>
<br/>
This can be used where the task input needs to be given in a csv file. The CSV file needs to be uploaded into Repository > CSV file prior to using the same in task design. Pull the node to task design window and update the properties.
</br>
<img src="" alt="Image 10" style=";;">
</br>
<br/>
Refer Using CSV In Jiffy for the further details on CSV. 
<br/>
Refer Designing An Automated Task In JIFFY - Example Step 1 for the details on configuring the CSV data node. 
<br/>
<br/>
<b>XML Data</b>
<br/>
This can be used where the task input needs to be given as XML data. The XML Data node expects the source file to be under <JiffyRoot> root element. Configuring XML data node is similar to CSV Data, XML file has to be selected instead of CSV file.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>JSON Data</b>
<br/>
This can be used where the task input needs to be given as JSON data.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>DB</b>
<br/>
A DB node is used when the input data is stored in the database. Jiffy DB(Database) node allows to connect to any configured Oracle Database. Jiffy allows Read/Update functionalities from the DB node. 
<br/>
Notes:
<br/>
* DB configuration has to be completed at <i>Task design > Configurations > Database Configurations</i> prior to using the node in tasks
<br/>
Refer Designing An Automated task In JIFFY - Example Step 2 for the details on configuring the DB node
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Docube Query</b>
<br/>
This node allows the user to take input data from Jiffy Docube application. Here user can write SQL queries to read data from CSV files available in Docube application. 
<br/>
Notes:
<br/>
<ul>
<li>Docube configuration has to be completed at Task design -> Docube Configurations prior to using the node in tasks </li>
<li>Query can be written to get data from existing CSV files from Docube applications. Only Select queries are allowed and the following are the formats to be used in queries</li>
<br/>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Sl No</th>
    <th>Description</th> 
    <th>Format to be used</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Basic Queries to fetch all the data from the file</td> 
    <td>select * from ${file_name}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Query to fetch records if a given string matching with values in a particular column of CSV</td>

{{< toggle title="Sterling Components" type="separator">}}
These are nodes which can be used to perform different actions in Sterling application.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Sterling API</b>
<br/>
To invoke an API call to Sterling application. Before using these nodes, complete sterling configuration under <i>Task Design > Configurations</i>. Mention the configuration name, API name to be invoked and the input and output XML templates to be used for API call in the properties of the node.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Service Node</b>
<br/>
To invoke a service call to Sterling application. Before using these nodes, complete sterling configuration under <i>Task Design > Configurations</i>. Mention the configuration name, Service name to be invoked and the input and output XML templates to be used for service call in the properties of the node.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>JMS Publisher</b>
<br/>
JMS Publisher node publishes messages to any standard queue that is configured to Sterling process/server. Sterling process/server in turn picks up the messages and processes the message based on the business rules. Before using these nodes, complete JMS queue configuration under <i>Task Design > Configurations</i>. Mention the configuration name and XML template to be used to publish message in the properties of node.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>JMS QueueBrowser</b>
<br/>
JMS QueueBrowser is used to browse for a message in the queue as per the given search criteria. The queue browser reads the last 1000 messages and returns the message which matches as per the selection criteria. 
<br/>
Example 1: An email confirmation message is sent to the customer once an invoice is processed in the application. In order to get the email details, user can use Jiffy JMS queue browser to read the messages in the queue and get the correct email details from the queue
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Sterling SOAP Request</b>
<br/>
To invoke a SOAP based service call to other applications. Before using these nodes, complete SOAP configuration under <i>Task Design > Configurations</i>. Mention the configuration name, Service name to be invoked and the input and output XML templates to be used for service call in the properties of the node.
{{< /toggle >}}
{{< toggle title="Validators" type="separator">}}
These are the data nodes which can be used to provide input data for the tasks

<br/>
<br/>
<b>Validator</b>
<br/>
This nodes can be used to implement all kind of validations required as part of task execution. Multiple levels of complex validations rules can be added using constant values/Variables/expressions and different operators like =,!=,<,>,<=,>=,like, AND,OR etc. 

By setting the toggle button - 'Stop on validation error' to ON in properties, the further execution of the tsk can be controlled.

{{< /toggle >}}
{{< toggle title="SubTasks" type="separator">}}
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Component</b>
<br/>
Components are used to save the frequently used Jiffy steps separately in repository so that those can be reused across tasks instead of writing the same steps again and again. These components can be used any number of times in any number of tasks.
<br/>
Please Refer to <i>Repository>components</i> to understand more on the usage of Components.
<br/>
<b>Start Sub Task & End Sub Task</b>
<br/>
Sub Task consists of two nodes: Start Sub Task and End Sub Task. They work as a group. Maximum loop count and Maximum time that a sub task to be executed can be defined in the properties. This can be used in cases where
<ul>
<li>A group of nodes needs to be executed until some criteria is met</li>
<li>A group of nodes needs to be executed for N times</li>
</ul>
For example, as part of a task execution, step 4 can be executed only if an email is triggered post step 3. Add a subtask group after step 3 with a maximum delay of X seconds and loop count of Y times. Add a validator for the email in between start sub task and end sub task. In this case, the execution will come out of subtask and proceed with the execution of subsequent nodes if any one of the below condition is satisfied
<ul>
<li>If all nodes in the subtask is passed successfully (if there are more than one validator node within subtask, all validator nodes has to be passed successfully)</li>
<li>If the loop count reaches Y times</li>
<li>If the subtask execution time reaches X seconds</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>If,Else&EndIf</b>
<br/>
If-else-End If nodes brings conditional execution in JIFFY. Refer <i>task>If - Else – Endif</i> for more details.
<br/>
<b>Task</b>
<br/>
Task node allows the users to access and execute another task of same release as a child task from the current task (Parent task). 
<br/>
Notes :
<ul>
<li>Any number of child task nodes can be added in the parent task</li>
<li>No data can be passed between child task and parent task. i.e Task node does not allow any data to be mapped to the child task from previous nodes or mapped from child task to use in further nodes of parent task</li>
<li>Nested tasks are not allowed, i.e another parent task (any task which has a task node) cannot be used in task node</li>
<li>Task nodes are not allowed in Components</li>
<li>Task nodes cannot be used in iteration. For example, if the execution of a task needs to be iterated with different input data, then a task node cannot be used</li>
<li>When CONTINUE ON FAILURE in properties is set to Off, if the child task execution is failed, then the nodes which comes after task node will not be executed</li>
<li>When the parent task executed from task design, the execution details of child task can be viewed only in Task Execution - > Execution History. The Run ID can be obtained  by clicking the view button of child task node and use the Run ID to get more details of the execution in Task Execution - > Execution History</li>
<li>When the parent task is executed form Task Execution tab, separate entries will be created in Execution history for parent task and each individual child task with all the execution details of each node</li>
</ul>
<b>Polling Nodes</b>
<br/>
Polling nodes are used to trigger the execution of other tasks continuously at given time interval. Only task nodes are allowed within polling nodes. The execution of polling nodes will be continued until it is stopped manually, irrespective of child tasks are successfully executed or failed. So this can be considered as a scheduler which can trigger the execution of other child tasks at a given time interval. 
<br/>
Polling task execution can be triggered either from Task Design or Task Execution.  As soon as the polling task execution is triggered it creates the following, 
<ul>
<li>An entry in polling history with Status as POLLING, which says the execution is in progress</li>
<li>An entry in Execution Summary for each child task with details as how many times the child tasks are executed, out of which how many are successful execution and how many are failed</li>
<li>An entry for each round of execution for each of the child task within polling nodes, i.e if the child task within the polling nodes are executed 50 times, the execution history will have 50 entries with the details of each round of execution</li>
<li>If the polling task is triggered from Task execution, in addition to the above-mentioned entries it will have an entry for parent task in Execution Summary and Execution History</li>
</ui>
<strong>Stopping the polling node execution</strong>x
<br/>
Once the execution is triggered, it can be stopped by selecting the record from Polling history. If the execution is triggered from Task Design, user can also stop the execution by using Stop Run button available in Task design window.
When the user click on Stop button, execution will not be instantly stopped, instead it will continue till the current iteration is completed for all the child tasks within polling nodes and then will be stopped.  Once stopped, the status of polling task in Polling History will be updated as STOPPED.
<br/>
Notes
<ul>
<li>Only task nodes are allowed within the polling nodes. In case if any other nodes are used, the polling will not be executed and the status in Polling history and Execution summary will be updated as INVALIDATED</li>
<li>No iterations are allowed within the polling nodes</li>
<li>Polling nodes are not allowed in components</li>
<li>Nested polling nodes are not allowed</li>
<li>Tasks which has polling node cannot be selected in Task nodes, ie those tasks cannot be used as child tasks</li>
<li>RESTART functionality will not be available for polling tasks</li>
</ul>

Jiffy UI nodes allows user to automate UI pages of any other application. For example, Web pages, Mainframe pages, SAP application, Desktop based applications etc. All UI nodes except Excel node works in similar method. Here automation is a two phase approach, first the UI pages needs to be familiarized using Jiffy UI Learn App and then scripting needs to be done in tasks using corresponding UI nodes. Please refer to UI automation using Jiffy for more details on this.
<br/>
But Excel node does not require UI familiarization, any excel sheet can be accessed and automated directly using Excel nodes. 
<br/>
<b>Web UI</b>
